HTML tags and comments can be used directly in WikiText. For example:

```
<article class="hello">
This is my nice and simple block of text. HelloThere
<!-- This comment will not appear in the wikified output -->
</article>
```

! Attributes

Attributes in HTML tags can be specified as a transclusion or a macro invocation. For example, here the value of the `href` attribute will be set to the value of the tiddler MyLinkDestination:

```
<a href={{MyLinkDestination}}>link</a>
```

Here an attribute is specified as a macro invocation:

```
<a href=<<MyMacro "Brian">>>link</a>
```

Literal attribute values can include line breaks. For example:

```
<div data-address="Mouse House,
Mouse Lane,
Rodentville,
Ratland."/>
```

By using triple-double quotes you can specify attribute values that include single double quotes. For example:

```
<div data-address="""Mouse House,
"Mouse" Lane,
Rodentville,
Ratland."""/>
```

! Content Parsing

The content of an HTML element will be parsed in inline mode unless the opening tag is followed by two linebreaks. (Inline mode means that block mode formatting such as tables, lists and headings is not recognised).
