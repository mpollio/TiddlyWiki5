type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

TiddlySpot is a free hosting service for TiddlyWiki documents from Simon and Daniel Baird. The easiest way to get started is to sign up for a new wiki at http://tiddlyspot.com - by default you'll get the latest release of TiddlyWiki.

You can upload an existing TiddlyWiki document from your local disc to TiddlySpot it by following these steps:

# Sign up for a new wiki at http://tiddlyspot.com/, and remember the wiki name and password
# Open your locally stored TiddlyWiki document in your browser
# Fill in the TiddlySpot wikiname and password in the control panel
# Click the "Save Changes" button. You should get a confirmation notification at the top right saying ''Saved wiki''. Saving can take several seconds if you're on a slow connection or working with a large wiki.
# Navigate to your TiddlySpot URL at http://{wikiname}.tiddlyspot.com/

Note that this procedure does not work in Firefox.

!! TiddlySpot Security

Your password is sent unencrypted when using TiddlySpot. From http://faq.tiddlyspot.com/:

''Is Tiddlyspot secure?''

No. Tiddlyspot does not use SSL/https. Your password is sent in clear text when uploading and when authenticating to access a private site. This means that your Tiddlyspot is vulnerable to packet sniffing and your password could be discovered by a malicious third party. Also your data is transmitted unencrypted when you view your site, even if it is a private site. For this reason please don't put sensitive information such as banking details in your Tiddlyspot and don't use a password that you use for other high security sites.
