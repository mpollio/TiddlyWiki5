The ''links'' filter operator replaces the current list with a list of the targets of outgoing links from those tiddlers.

For example:

|!Filter String |!Description |
|`[[HelloThere]links[]]` |Returns the titles of tiddlers linked from `HelloThere` |
|`[all[current]links[]]` |Returns the titles of tiddlers linked from the current tiddler |
