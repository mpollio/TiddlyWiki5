description: Saves a group of raw tiddlers to a directory

Saves a group of tiddlers in their raw text or binary format to the specified directory. 

```
--savetiddlers <filter> <pathname>
```

By default, the pathname is resolved relative to the `output` subdirectory of the edition directory. The `--output` command can be used to direct output to a different directory.

Any missing directories in the pathname are automatically created.
